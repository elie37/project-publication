Project Overview
This project presents the design and implementation of an IoT-based robotic system for serving tea in academic institutions.  
The system aims to improve convenience, efficiency, and affordability in tea service through automation, reducing queues, manual errors, and operational delays.

Key technologies used include:
- ESP32 microcontroller: for control and IoT connectivity
- RFID cards: for cashless payments
- LCD display: for user interaction
- Water pump: and relay module for dispensing
- Keypad: for order selection
- MySQL database: for user accounts and transaction logging
Features
- Cashless Payment: RFID-based authentication and payment
- Automated Dispensing: Serves tea portions based on user’s balance
- Real-time Monitoring: IoT-enabled remote tracking of transactions and system status
- User Interface: Simple LCD and keypad for ordering
- Scalable Design: Future integration of AMRs/AGVs for delivery to classrooms
- Transparency: All transactions stored and viewable for accountability
